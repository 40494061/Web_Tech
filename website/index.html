				<h1>Greetings comrade!</h1>
				<p>&nbsp; Today we are going to play a game, this game will involve attempting to go to a shop and buy a pint of milk in the Glorious Free Peoples Democratic Republic of Scotland.</p>	  
				<p>&nbsp; It sounds simple, but be warned, the Glorious Free Peoples Democratic Republic of Scotland is a progressive society and will not tolerate intolerance.</p>  
				<p>&nbsp; While being a free and democratic place there are 1 or 2 million laws to follow.</p>					  
				<p>&nbsp; These small little minor bits of legislation merely govern every aspect of your life.</p>
