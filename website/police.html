				<h2>"YOUR NOT IN ANY TROUBLE, WE JUST WANT TO TALK"</h2>
				<p>&nbsp; Oh no! You may not think you have have committed a crime, but with 90 billion laws how can you be sure.</p>	  
				<p>&nbsp; Ignorance of the law is not a defence and since everyone has been turned into a criminal, they will get you for something.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; The police stare at you with their soulless eyes, mouths salivating at how many boxes in their quota's they can make you tick.</p>
				<p>&nbsp; Compassion, common sense and telling the truth was not part of their training, be very, very carefull how you interact with these goons.</p>
